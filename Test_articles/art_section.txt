1. Introduction
The next big steps in exoplanetary science is to investigate the
physical conditions on worlds outside our solar system. One of
the most promising methods for this is so-called transit spectroscopy, which makes it possible to determine physical parameters of the exoplanetary atmosphere, most noticeably the chemical composition, but possibly also pressure and temperature profiles, rotation period, global weather patterns, cloud coverage,
etc.
From radial velocity measurements and transit light curves,
orbital parameters, radius, mass, and mean density of an exoplanet can be calculated (Winn 2010). With this, one can divide exoplanets into categories, such as gas giants, ice giants,
and rocky planets. A large number of the discovered exoplanets are 

Molecules responsible for the observed absorption features typically can not be identified directly due to low resolution. .

2. Method
Here we describe the data analysis method for ground-based
high-resolution transit spectroscopy.
2.1. Synthetic observations

A simulated spectrum
(S˜ n ) of a star with a transiting exoplanet reaching our detector is
computed as
"
#
R2p
S˜ n (λ, t) = F(λ, v s) − i p (λ, φ, v s) 2 − ia (λ, φ, v s)P(λ, v s+p) · T (λ, t)

The expression in square brackets replaces the contribution of
the obscured area on the stellar surface with the stellar light that
passes through the exoplanetary atmosphere. Here F is the flux
of the star, and i p and ia are the specific intensities at the position
of the planet or its atmosphere. These are given by integrating
the specific intensity (I, characterized by the normalized limb
distance, µ,) 
+- (A p )
or the semi-transparent atmosphere (Aa ).integration can be used to represent this movement, integrating over
the motion across the stellar disk. R2p /R2⋆ is the fraction of the

represented by v s .  by v p . 
The resulting spectrum is convolved with an instrumental profile (Γ), which is approximated b
 inverse of the S/N selected for the data. We have ignored the effect of the blaze on the
S/N within a spectral order. Finally, the spectrum is continuum
normalized (η), and with this the full observation is created:

S n (λ, t) = S˜ n (λ, t)
Γ · (1 − N(λ, φ)) · η.

To take the temporal changes in telluric transmittance into account accurately, as well as to use specific intensity corresponding to the different parts of the stellar disk that the planet covers
during the transit, it is preferable to use many short exposures
(0.5 - 2 min) of the transit rather than a single long integration.
An example of a synthetic observation is given in Fig. 1.
2.2. Data analysis method

Once simulated observations are produced, we may use them to
reconstruct the transmission spectrum of the exoplanet (P). The
straightforward approach would be to rewrite Eqs. 1 and 2 to

"
−S n (λ, t, −v s+p ) · ν(φ)

n n T (λ, t, −v s+p ) · ia (λ, φ, −v p)

#
F(λ, −v p ) − R2p /R2⋆ i p (λ, φ, −v p ) N
Γ.
ia (λ, φ, −v p)

(3)


An alternative approach is to formulate and solve an inverse
problem. Instead of using the expression for P explicitly, we
formulate an optimization problem, where we are searching for
the function P that minimizes the expression below:
Φ≡

X(
nλ

iN
P(λ, v0 ) · T (λ, t, −v s+p ) · ia (λ, φ, −v p)

i N )2
2
2
R p /R⋆ i p (λ, φ, −v p ) · T (λ, t, −v s+p )
Γ = min.
This is essentially a rewritten version of Eqs. 1 and 2. To be
able to combine spectra, we need all spectra to be on the same
wavelength grid. Observations (S ), telluric transmittance (T ),
stellar flux (F), and specific intensity (i) are shifted and interpolated onto the rest frame of the exoplanet. These changes in
the wavelength grid are represented by v s and v p for stellar radial
velocity relative to observer (v s ) and exoplanet radial orbital velocity relative to the star (v p ). Exoplanet rest frame is used for
The optimal value of ν is found by calculating the
residuals (r in Eq. 5) between observations multiplied with ν and
continuum normalized synthetic observations in a given phase.

There are many ways to formulate an inverse problem for P. The
form given by Eq. 4 has the advantage of avoiding division by
quantities that may turn to zero (telluric transmittance) and of
differences between subtracted terms not being orders of magnitude. With this set-up, the noise may still introduce large fluctuations around the mean value, which now can be controlled.
This is done by selecting weights (see below) along the wavelength grid and adding a regularization term (R), which controls
the balance between the smoothness of the solution and the fit to
the observation. Now the minimization problem can be written
as
Ω ≡ Φ + Λ · R = min
X dP(λ) !2
R=

(7)

The minimum of Ω is obtained by requiring the derivatives of
Ω to be zero and by linearizing the equation for R.

M dwarfs) during transit and applied the data-analysis method to
these "observations". Simulations were performed with a hypothetical state of the art high-resolution spectrograph with spectral resolution R=100 000 and simultaneous wavelength coverage 1.5 - 2.5 µm. The S/N of simulated observations is based
on estimates of what modern instruments at 8m class telescopes
will be able to achieve during 75 s exposures of the two stars.
For a solar-like star (K mag 8) S/N ≈ 150 and M-dwarf (K mag
9) S/N ≈ 90 per resolution element. The S/N is estimated to be at
the centre of the K band. For simplicity we assumed that the S/N
is constant throughout the observed spectral range and ignored
readout and sky noise (sky emission discussed in Sec. 4.2). If
these noise sources are significant, the integration time should
be adjusted to reach desirable S/N levels.
The duration of a transit is an important parameter when estimating the capabilities of the data analysis method, since it directly limits the total observing time. Transit durations range
from slightly below one to many hours, approaching a whole
day in extreme cases. The correlation between the size of the
star and transit duration is not straightforward. Planets transiting larger stars cross a larger stellar disk, but at the same time
the stars are more massive, meaning higher orbital velocities.
On top of this, the semi major axis (and to a lesser degree the
inclination and eccentricity of the orbit) affects the transit duration. Looking at statistics of transit durations from the the Exoplanet Orbit Database (Wright et al. 2011), we find longer average transit duration for planets orbiting larger stars (see Fig.
3). For hot-Jupiters transiting solar-like stars (here taken as
planets with R p > 0.5R Jup, a < 0.3au and orbiting stars with
0.8R⊙ < R⋆ > 1.2R⊙), the median transit duration is 165 minutes. We use this as the transit duration for the hot-Jupiter case.
For the Earth-like super-Earth, we place this planet in the
habitable zone (the distance from the star at which liquid water
is possible). The inner and outer edges of the habitable zone

 However, the success of
the Kepler space missions has demonstrated that the chances of
finding observationally advantageous super-Earths on the southern hemisphere is high, so all we need are dedicated space-based
transit surv eys.
