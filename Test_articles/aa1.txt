ABSTRACT

Context. We propose a method for observing transiting exoplanets with near-infrared high-resolution spectrometers.
Aims. We aim to create a robust data analysis method for recovering atmospheric transmission spectra from transiting exoplanets over
a wide wavelength range in the near infrared.
Methods. By using an inverse method approach, combined with stellar models and telluric transmission spectra, the method recovers
the transiting exoplanet’s atmospheric transmittance at high precision over a wide wavelength range. We describe our method and
have tested it by simulating observations.
Results. This method is capable of recovering transmission spectra of high enough accuracy to identify absorption features from
molecules such as O2 , CH4 , CO2 , and H2 O. This accuracy is achievable for Jupiter-size exoplanets at S/N that can be reached for 8m
class telescopes using high-resolution spectrometers (R > 20 000) during a single transit, and for Earth-size planets and super-Earths
transiting late K or M dwarf stars at S/N reachable during observations of less than 10 transits. We also analyse potential error sources
to show the robustness of the method.
Conclusions. Detection and characterization of atmospheres of both Jupiter-size planets and smaller rocky planets looks promising
using this set-up.

1. Introduction
The next big steps in exoplanetary science is to investigate the
physical conditions on worlds outside our solar system. One of
the most promising methods for this is so-called transit spectroscopy, which makes it possible to determine physical parameters of the exoplanetary atmosphere, most noticeably the chemical composition, but possibly also pressure and temperature profiles, rotation period, global weather patterns, cloud coverage,
etc.
From radial velocity measurements and transit light curves,
orbital parameters, radius, mass, and mean density of an exoplanet can be calculated (Winn 2010). With this, one can divide exoplanets into categories, such as gas giants, ice giants,
and rocky planets. A large number of the discovered exoplanets are categorized as hot-Jupiters, which are gas giants orbiting
their stars often at distances closer than Mercury to the Sun. The
ubiquity of such objects represents a challenge to our planetarysystem formation theories (Boss 1997; Nagasawa et al. 2008;
Coleman & Nelson 2014). Another problem is the discrepancy
between mass and radius for many smaller exoplanets, which
falls between the rocky and gas planets of the solar system. Several possible solutions have been proposed, such as ocean planets, rocky planets with large extended atmospheres, or metalpoor planetary cores (similar to that of the moon), but the
true nature of these worlds remains unclear (Léger et al. 2004;
Castan & Menou 2011; Rogers & Seager 2010).
Monitoring stellar brightness over long periods of time in
search of exoplanet transits (i.e. when the exoplanet moves in
front of its host star from our points of view) has proven to

be a very successful detection method. Since the first observed
transit event (Charbonneau et al. 2000), more than one thousand
(November 2014) transiting exoplanets have been discovered.
The success of the transit method for exoplanet detection comes
mainly from the ability to observe many potential systems simultaneously.
The feasibility of exoatmosphere detection by transit observations has been demonstrated by several authors (Brown 2001;
Hubbard et al. 2001; Seager & Sasselov 2000). During the transit, stellar light can pass directly though the semi-transparent part
of the atmosphere. The low contrast ratio between an exoplanetary atmosphere and its host star makes detecting the atmosphere
a challenging task. The projection of a planetary atmosphere for
a solar-size star covers of the order of 10−3 of the stellar disk for
Jupiter-size planets, and can be as low as 10−6 for super-Earths
and Earth-size planets.
Many successful detections using transit spectroscopy have
been made. The two most commonly used methods for obtaining transit spectra are (1) low-resolution spectroscopy or photometric measurements of the transit light curve in filters corresponding to typical broadband absorption features, which was
first demonstrated by Jha et al. (2000); and (2) high-resolution
narrow-band spectroscopy targeting a specific absorption line (or
band of lines), first demonstrated by Charbonneau et al. (2002).
The transit curves from the first method are used to calculate
the radius of the planet as a function of wavelength. Differences in perceived radius of a planet in different filters are interpreted as the presence of a semi-transparent atmosphere. This
method makes it possible to recreate the transmission spectrum
over a wide wavelength range, albeit at low spectral resolution.

Molecules responsible for the observed absorption features typically can not be identified directly due to low resolution. Instead one usually tries to find the best fitting model of the planetary atmosphere based on a library of such models. The second
method depends less on models. Here one targets an absorption
line of a molecule assumed to be present in the atmosphere of
a planet. By measuring the relative intensity dip at wavelengths
corresponding to this line and the intensity at wavelengths close
to this, the presence of the molecule can be detected. Both these
methods are applicable to ground- and space-based observations,
although space offers a number of obvious advantages.
One of the best studied hot-Jupiters is HD 209485 b, which
is slightly larger than Jupiter (R p = 1.36R Jup) and which
orbits a bright (V mag = 7.7) solar-like star. HST STIS
spectra of this exoplanet during transit has led to the detection of sodium (Charbonneau et al. 2002), atomic hydrogen
(Vidal-Madjar et al. 2003; Ballester et al. 2007), oxygen, carbon (Vidal-Madjar et al. 2004), magnesium (Vidal-Madjar et al.
2013), and molecular hydrogen (Lecavelier Des Etangs et al.
2008). Using a new observational strategy (ground-based highresolution spectroscopy, CRIRES at VLT) and data analysis
method, Snellen et al. (2010) detected CO absorption in the exoplanet’s atmosphere. Another well-studied hot-Jupiter is HD
189733 b, for which methane and water (Swain et al. 2008)
were detected using HST observations, and sodium was detected through high-resolution ground-based observation (HRS
at HET) (Redfield et al. 2008).
Smaller exoplanets require smaller host stars such that
R star /R planet favours detection of exoplanetary atmospheres. The
atmospheric transmittance of the Neptune-size exoplanet GJ 436
b has been measured, revealing a mostly featureless spectrum in
near infra-red (NIR) (Pont et al. 2009; Knutson et al. 2014).
The most extensively studied super-Earth is GJ 1214 b
(Bean et al. 2010, 2011; Carter et al. 2011a; Croll et al. 2011;
Crossfield et al. 2011; Désert et al. 2011; Berta et al. 2012;
Murgas et al. 2012; de Mooij et al. 2012, 2013; Colón & Gaidos
2013; Fraine et al. 2013; Narita et al. 2013; Teske et al. 2013;
Wilson et al. 2014; Cáceres et al. 2014; Kreidberg et al. 2014).
The small host star (an M dwarf with Rstar = 0.21R⊙) gives the
planet a favourable contrast ratio. The combined wavelength
coverage from these studies ranges from 0.4 to 5 µm. Most
studies have concluded that GJ 1214 b has a flat and featureless transmission spectrum, usually suggested to be caused either by a water-dominated atmosphere or by high altitude clouds
or hazes.
These efforts have shown that with current methods and instruments, it is indeed possible to detect exoplanetary transmission spectra. The strong model dependence of the fitting procedure may, however, introduce uncertainties and degeneracies
in the analysis of the atmosphere. The goal of this paper is to
present an alternative observational strategy and data analysis
that is capable of obtaining exoplanetary atmospheric transmittance over a wide wavelength range with sufficient resolution
to identify the sources of spectral features directly from their
shapes and placements. From such a spectrum, the chemical
composition and physical conditions in the atmospheres could
be deduced with less model dependence. Examples in this paper
are in NIR due to our interest and involvement in the CRIRES+
upgrade (see Sec. 5), but we foresee no reasons that this could
not be applied to other instruments or wavelength domains. We
also formulate the instrumental requirements needed to obtain
suitable observations for this method.

2. Method
Here we describe the data analysis method for ground-based
high-resolution transit spectroscopy.
2.1. Synthetic observations

To test the data analysis method, we need observations of transiting exoplanets. To have control over the data and to know
the accuracy of the reconstructed exoplanet transmission spectrum, we create artificial observations with a hypothetical highresolution spectrograph. This way we have full control over the
signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), the ratio of planetary-to-stellar radius, atmospheric conditions, radial velocity, etc., and thus are
able to reliably estimate the requirements for instruments and
target selection. The simulated observations are based on several assumptions, as follows.
1. A solid (or cloud-covered) part of the planet blocks stellar
light completely in the observed wavelengths, while the atmosphere above absorbs light as a function of wavelength.
2. The exposure times are short enough to ignore the motion of
the planet across the stellar disk during a single exposure.
3. The stellar flux spectrum and exoplanet transmission spectrum remain constant during the whole transit.
4. The noise of observations is dominated by photon statistics.
We simulate several short exposures of the transiting system as
the planet moves across the stellar disk. A simulated spectrum
(S˜ n ) of a star with a transiting exoplanet reaching our detector is
computed as
"

The expression in square brackets replaces the contribution of
the obscured area on the stellar surface with the stellar light that
passes through the exoplanetary atmosphere. Here F is the flux
of the star, and i p and ia are the specific intensities at the position
of the planet or its atmosphere. These are given by integrating
the specific intensity (I, characterized by the normalized limb
distance, µ,) over the area of the opaque part of the planet (A p )
or the semi-transparent atmosphere (Aa ). If the planet moves
significantly over the stellar disk during an exposure, the integration can be used to represent this movement, integrating over
the motion across the stellar disk. R2p /R2⋆ is the fraction of the
stellar disk that is obscured by the opaque part of the planet.
Our goal is to recover the transmittance of the exoplanet atmosphere, represented by P, where P is calculated using the
wavelength dependent height of the opaque atmosphere H and
is rescaled in units of stellar disk area. This means that P is the
fraction of the stellar disk that is blocked by absorption in the
atmosphere. Telluric transmittance is given by T , and because

stellar contribution.

of temporal variations (represented by t), we allow T to change
with each exposure. Simulations of observed spectra are made
for many short exposures, which are represented by subscript n.
Each exposure is taken during a given point in the orbit of the
exoplanet, represented by phase φ, which in turn corresponds to
different µ as the exoplanet moves across the stellar disk during
the transit. The rotation of the Earth (of the order of 0.5 km/s),
and the star-planet system’s velocity relative to Earth will result
in a small Doppler shift in the stellar spectrum relative to the instrument, represented by v s . The exoplanet will also move in its
orbit during the transit. The radial velocity of a planet in transit is generally small, but for planets orbiting very close to their
stars, variations during the transit produces non-negligible red
and blue shifts, which is represented by v p . All velocities are
given relative to the detector.
The resulting spectrum is convolved with an instrumental profile (Γ), which is approximated by a Gaussian with the
FWHM given by the spectral resolution of the instrument (which
we assume to be constant over the entire wavelength range). We
then add white noise to each pixel. The realization of the noise
(N) for a certain exposure is given by Poisson distribution, with
the width of the distribution given by the inverse of the S/N selected for the data. We have ignored the effect of the blaze on the
S/N within a spectral order. Finally, the spectrum is continuum
normalized (η), and with this the full observation is created:

To take the temporal changes in telluric transmittance into account accurately, as well as to use specific intensity corresponding to the different parts of the stellar disk that the planet covers
during the transit, it is preferable to use many short exposures
(0.5 - 2 min) of the transit rather than a single long integration.
An example of a synthetic observation is given in Fig. 1.
2.2. Data analysis method

Once simulated observations are produced, we may use them to
reconstruct the transmission spectrum of the exoplanet (P). The
straightforward approach would be to rewrite Eqs. 1 and 2 to

ia (λ, φ, −v p)

(3)

Summation is carried out over many short exposures taken during the transit and then divided by the total number of exposures.
Before adding spectra, all spectra are shifted to the reference
frame of the exoplanet. Solving Eq. 3, however, fails to recover
the exoplanet spectrum since the resulting reconstructed planetary spectrum is swamped by noise amplified in wavelength regions where the denominator (usually telluric transmittance) is
small. Rebinning the data to a lower resolution will not help because we will lose the information available between the telluric
lines.
An alternative approach is to formulate and solve an inverse
problem. Instead of using the expression for P explicitly, we
formulate an optimization problem, where we are searching for
the function P that minimizes the expression below:
Φ≡

R p /R⋆ i p (λ, φ, −v p ) · T (λ, t, −v s+p )
Γ = min.
This is essentially a rewritten version of Eqs. 1 and 2. To be
able to combine spectra, we need all spectra to be on the same
wavelength grid. Observations (S ), telluric transmittance (T ),
stellar flux (F), and specific intensity (i) are shifted and interpolated onto the rest frame of the exoplanet. These changes in
the wavelength grid are represented by v s and v p for stellar radial
velocity relative to observer (v s ) and exoplanet radial orbital velocity relative to the star (v p ). Exoplanet rest frame is used for
establishing the wavelength vector, and we assume that P is constant during the transit. We also assume that the observed spectra
is continuum-normalized, but a perfect normalization will differ for the spectra in and outside the transit, accounting for the
change in stellar flux. This problem should be addressed from
two sides. On the data reduction side, we can use a robust and reproducible algorithm. We have developed such a tool and tested
it with a number of fibre-fed and slit spectrographs, including
ESO HARPS and UVES and the Keck HIRES. The main idea
is to observe the solar spectrum (e.g. reflected from an asteroid)
before and after the science exposures keeping instrument configuration. Sensitivity curves derived from the solar spectrum are
then used to normalize the science exposures. In the absence of
large seeing variations, this techniques provides precise continuum normalization at the level of 10−3 . In addition, we introduce
the brightness correction parameter ν on the modelling side. This
parameter primarily depends on stellar limb darkening and exoplanet radius. The optimal value of ν is found by calculating the
residuals (r in Eq. 5) between observations multiplied with ν and
continuum normalized synthetic observations in a given phase.
We search for the value of ν that minimizes the cross-correlation
of residual with stellar spectra and residual with telluric spectra
(see Eq. 6):

There are many ways to formulate an inverse problem for P. The
form given by Eq. 4 has the advantage of avoiding division by
quantities that may turn to zero (telluric transmittance) and of
differences between subtracted terms not being orders of magnitude. With this set-up, the noise may still introduce large fluctuations around the mean value, which now can be controlled.
This is done by selecting weights (see below) along the wavelength grid and adding a regularization term (R), which controls
the balance between the smoothness of the solution and the fit to
the observation. Now the minimization problem can be written
as
Ω ≡ Φ + Λ · R = min
X dP(λ) !2
R=
dλ
λ

(7)

The minimum of Ω is obtained by requiring the derivatives of
Ω to be zero and by linearizing the equation for R. Then, P is
given by a system of linear equations with a tridiagonal matrix,
which is fast and easy to solve. In this exact formulation of Eq.
4, the telluric absorption acts as a weight; in places with strong
absorption (T ≈ 0), the regularization dominates, keeping the
oscillations of the solution under control across the affected intervals. The constant Λ is a free parameter, which balances the
relative importance of regularization. For a given dataset, a value
of Λ must be chosen and possibly be significantly affecting the
recovered solution. In our tests of the method, we can compare
the obtained solution to the original "true" exoplanet transmission spectrum (what we put into simulated observations). By
searching for the Λ that gives the smallest least squares difference between these two, we can find an optimal Λ. When applying this method to the real observations (with the exoplanet
spectrum being unknown), the optimal value of Λ can be derived
in similar numerical experiments using the correct parameters of
the system (size of planet to star, duration of transit, instrumental parameters, estimated S/N). The regularization imposes extra smoothness on the solution, but while this dumps numerical
noise, it also reduces spectral resolution of the recovered spectrum in places of high telluric absorption.
An additional advantage of this approach to recovering the
exoplanetary spectrum is that one can combine observations of
several different transits. As long as each single exposure is combined with corresponding telluric and stellar spectra within the
summation in Eq. 4, adding exposures from several transits is
possible without any additional complications. For this we assume that the exoplanet transmittance does not change from one
transit to the next.
In this set-up of the inverse problem, stellar flux spectrum
and specific intensity spectra at each µ point, telluric transmittance and relative areas of star and planet are all needed. How to
achieve this is covered in Sec. 4, but for now we assume that all
these data are available with sufficient accuracy.
Article number, page 4 of 14

Now we proceed with testing the proposed method and estimating requirements for both the observed exoplanet system and the
instrument.
3.1. Data sources

For simulating observations and extracting the exoplanet transmission spectrum, three components are needed, stellar spectra (flux and specific intensity), exoplanet atmospheric transmission spectrum, and telluric transmittance. For the tests below, the high-resolution flux and specific intensity spectra of the
stars were computed with the stellar atmosphere modelling code
MARCS (Gustafsson et al. 2008). One-dimensional hydrostatic
MARCS models are based on the most advanced atomic and
molecular opacities, and they are extensively tested against real
data for the Sun, cool dwarfs, sub-giants, and giants. The quality of the stellar model atmospheres was assessed using spectral
synthesis, which also gives the estimate of the quality and completeness of the line lists. In the case of the Sun, the comparison
was also done for a wavelength-dependent limb darkening. For
simulations of observations and for the data-analysis method, we
need the intensity corresponding to the area of the star occulted
by the planet or its atmosphere. This is obtained by integrating
the specific intensity over the area covered by the planet or by
the the semi-transparent atmosphere. Variations in specific intensity across the projection of the planetary disk are much less
than 1% (ignoring the presence of active regions), and the integration over the planetary disk can be replaced safely by the
cental value. However, in a some cases this is important to include, such as when observing large planets transiting small stars
(especially close to the limb of the star), when only part of the
planet covers the stellar disk (being able to include these cases
enables us to acquire a few additional exposures at the beginning and end of the transit) or when the exposure time is long
and the planet moves across the stellar disk during the exposure.
In our tests we have focused on two different cases: a Jupitersize planet in front of a solar-like star and a super-Earth in front
of an M dwarf. Flux and intensity spectra were computed for
two stars with parameters according to Table 1.

The telluric transmittance was calculated using the atmospheric modelling code LinePak (Gordley et al. 1994) implemented on the website http://spectralcalc.com, which provides
calculations of transmission spectra of the telluric atmosphere
under given conditions. The atmospheric model used in LinePak
for integrating the transmission spectrum are the U.S. Standard
Atmosphere, which provides pressure and temperature profiles,
as well as partial pressures for various gases. In particular,
the molecules dominating the NIR absorption such as O2 , O3 ,
H2 0, CO2 , CH4 , and HNO3 are all included in the calculations.
The line lists used for calculating the absorption bands of these
molecules were taken from HITRAN (Rothman et al. 2009). To

ments, the altitude was set to 2.6 km and the water vapour concentration reduced to 20% of the default concentration in the
U.S. Standard Atmosphere where PWV = 14.3 mm. Observations are then synthesized with an airmass varying from 1.0 to
1.2 during a single transit, to represent the star moving downwards from zenith during three hours of observations.
The projected exoplanetary atmosphere is characterize by its
height. We define atmosphere height (often referred to as eclipsing height) as the additional radius that a completely opaque disk
would have. This disk blocks the same amount of stellar light as
the planet with a semitransparent atmosphere. At wavelengths
where the atmosphere is mostly opaque, a larger opaque disk is
needed to block the same amount of light, and thus the eclipsing
height of the atmosphere is larger at wavelengths where the atmosphere absorbs more light. For the Earth viewed in NIR, the
radius would vary between 6 385 km (in wavelength regions with
no absorption) and 6 470 km (in wavelength regions with much
absorption), making the eclipsing atmosphere height between 0
and 85 km.
Transmission spectra for super-Earth atmospheres (Fig. 2)
were created using the same model as the telluric transmission
spectrum (LinePak), but increasing the impact parameter of the
rays up to 100 km above the surface. We used two different
atmospheric models: one with temperature, pressure, and composition identical to Earth and one more Venus-like, with CH4
and H2 O replaced by CO and CO2 . Using an exo-atmosphere
with a different composition than the Earth’s enabled us to test
that the data analysis method produces artificial features originating in the telluric atmosphere, while an Earth-like atmosphere
enabled us to test whether we can reproduce spectral features
that also exist in the telluric atmosphere. Super-Earths typically
have surface gravity within 0.9 - 1.1 of the Earth’s (exoplanet orbit database Wright et al. (2011)), which makes the atmospheric
scale height for super-Earths with the same atmospheric temperature and mean molecular weight as the Earth or very similar to
the Earth’s (8.5 km). Therefore we used the atmosphere height
directly from the telluric model. For the Venus-like super-Earth,
we wanted to test a more extended atmosphere. If the planet is
hotter, the scale height will increase. We used a scale height that
is twice as large as for the Earth. On top of this, the CO2 in the
atmosphere absorbs light very efficiently, making the eclipsing
atmosphere height of the Venus-like planet almost 200 km. For
planetary radius, we used 2.5 R⊕ in both cases.
Hot-Jupiter model spectra (Fig. 2) were derived in a similar manner, computing the optical length of the rays at different distances from planet centre. The total transmittance was
then evaluated using the projected areas of the corresponding
concentric rings. The atmospheric structure was taken from
Miguel & Kaltenegger (2014). Opacity contributors used in this
model include H2 , CH4 , CO, N2 , NH3 , H2 O, PH3 , H2 S, TiO, VO,
CaH, MgH, FeH, CrH, SiO, CaOH, and TiH. (We do not include
any clouds or hazes.) The model atmosphere height is 5 600
km (scale height 500 km) on top of a completely opaque core
with radius 90 000 km. This model planet is slightly larger than
the average hot-Jupiter. We scale the radius and eclipsing atmosphere height to match a Jupiter-size planet (radius 69 900 km).
Roughly four-fifths of currently known hot-Jupiters are Jupiter
size or larger, making this a conservative estimate for the size of
a hot-Jupiter.

M dwarfs) during transit and applied the data-analysis method to
these "observations". Simulations were performed with a hypothetical state of the art high-resolution spectrograph with spectral resolution R=100 000 and simultaneous wavelength coverage 1.5 - 2.5 µm. The S/N of simulated observations is based
on estimates of what modern instruments at 8m class telescopes
will be able to achieve during 75 s exposures of the two stars.
For a solar-like star (K mag 8) S/N ≈ 150 and M-dwarf (K mag
9) S/N ≈ 90 per resolution element. The S/N is estimated to be at
the centre of the K band. For simplicity we assumed that the S/N
is constant throughout the observed spectral range and ignored
readout and sky noise (sky emission discussed in Sec. 4.2). If
these noise sources are significant, the integration time should
be adjusted to reach desirable S/N levels.
The duration of a transit is an important parameter when estimating the capabilities of the data analysis method, since it directly limits the total observing time. Transit durations range
from slightly below one to many hours, approaching a whole
day in extreme cases. The correlation between the size of the
star and transit duration is not straightforward. Planets transiting larger stars cross a larger stellar disk, but at the same time
the stars are more massive, meaning higher orbital velocities.
On top of this, the semi major axis (and to a lesser degree the
inclination and eccentricity of the orbit) affects the transit duration. Looking at statistics of transit durations from the the Exoplanet Orbit Database (Wright et al. 2011), we find longer average transit duration for planets orbiting larger stars (see Fig.
3). For hot-Jupiters transiting solar-like stars (here taken as
planets with R p > 0.5R Jup, a < 0.3au and orbiting stars with
0.8R⊙ < R⋆ > 1.2R⊙), the median transit duration is 165 minutes. We use this as the transit duration for the hot-Jupiter case.
For the Earth-like super-Earth, we place this planet in the
habitable zone (the distance from the star at which liquid water
is possible). The inner and outer edges of the habitable zone

depend on many things, such as the planet’s surface gravity, atmospheric pressure, and greenhouse effects. The eccentricity of
the orbit and the rotation of the planet complicate this further.
To get rough estimates of the habitable zone, we use the orbital
distance of the Earth and scale it with inverse square of stellar
luminosity, and this distance is then converted to a transit duration (assuming inclination 90◦ . For an M dwarf this would give
a transit duration of 90 minutes. For the Venus-like super-Earth,
we use the same method and scale the semi-major axis to match
the semi-major axis of Venus, giving us a transit duration of 75
minutes. See Table 2 for details on orbital parameters.
For each case we show four spectra in the same panel (Fig.
4). The solution of the inverse problem, corresponding to the recovered exoplanet transmission spectrum, is shown in red. To
show how accurate the recovery is, the original transmission
spectrum of the exoplanetary atmosphere is shown in black.
Along with this we over plot (dashed grey line) the input exoplanet spectrum with the same amount of weighted regularization as the recovered solution. These spectra are represented by
their atmospheric height (defined as in Sec. 3.1), with the axis
on left-hand side of each figure. We also include the telluric
transmission in greyish blue to indicate the parts of the wavelength regime where the telluric transmittance, hence the signal,
is very low. This is represented by the transmittance axis on the
right-hand side of each figure.
Results from the tests are shown in Fig. 4. For the hot-Jupiter
(R = 1R Jup ) transiting a solar-like star, the strongest recovered
absorption bands coincide with the major absorption bands in
the input spectrum. In the tests with a super-Earth with Earthlike transmittance, we had to combine observations from four
transits (corresponding to a total of 6 hours of observations) in
order to recover the major H2 O, CO2 , and CH4 bands, and even
with observations from four transits, the results are noisy and
contain a few spurious features. The Venus-like exoplanet is
more advantageous than the Earth-like case mainly because of
its larger atmosphere, and we manage to recover the major absorption bands during a single 75-minute-long transit.

4. Requirements
Owing to the very small fraction of the stellar disk that is blocked
by the exoplanet atmosphere, recovering exoplanetary transmission spectra puts heavy requirements on observations, input data,
and the targeted planetary system. Based on simulations of varying input parameter, we tried to estimate requirements for transit
spectroscopy using this data analysis method. Unless noted otherwise, all tests in this section are done with the same planet and
star parameters as the Venus-like super-Earth case above, see Table 2.

4.1. Observational requirements

The two most important characteristics of observations, and
therefore the instrument, are (1) spectral resolution and (2) wavelength coverage.
1. Spectral resolution: The resolution of the spectrograph is a vital aspect of the instrument. With high resolution, we are able to
see between telluric lines and detect contribution from the exoplanet that might not be observable if using lower resolution. We

Fig. 5. Recovered exoplanetary transmission spectra from simulated
transit observations of hot super-Earth transiting M5 star. We simulate observations using instruments with different spectral resolution to
show the importance of high spectral resolution.

can use this to see molecular species present in both the telluric
and the exoplanetary atmosphere, since there will be a small radial velocity difference between the telluric atmosphere and the
exoplanet. This will shift the exoplanetary lines relative to the
telluric lines, and this difference is detectable with high resolution. With a varying radial velocity difference during a transit,
we will also be able to scan for exoplanetary lines superpositioned on telluric features, thanks to the rotation of the Earth and
the orbit of the exoplanet.
To show the importance of high resolution, we simulated observations with spectral resolution of 10 000, 50 000 and 100 000
and applied the data-analysis method. Results of these tests are
shown in Fig. 5. Recovering the exoplanet spectrum is possible
at resolutions less than 100 000, but better spectral resolution
relaxes the required S/N. At resolution R = 50 000 recovering
exoplanet spectrum in regions with strong telluric absorption is
difficult. At spectral resolution below 50 000, telluric and exoatmospheric lines blend, and the recovery of exoplanet spectrum
deteriorates. It is no longer possible to differentiate spurious features from true absorption bands.
There are two factors that affect the resolution of the recovered exoplanet spectrum, the instrumental resolution and the regularization parameter. If data quality is very high (i.e. high S/N
and/or many combined transits), one can afford to reduce regularization and still recover exoplanet transmission spectrum with

high accuracy. In the most favourable cases, when combining
many transits of bright star with a transiting hot-Jupiter, we are
able to reconstruct individual lines. To illustrate the effect of
high resolution, we simulated observations from 15 transits of
the same Jupiter size exoplanet and solar-like star as used previously. We do this with spectral resolutions of 100 000, 50 000,
and 10 000. We show a small region of the reconstructed exoplanetary spectrum where we reconstruct individual lines (see
Fig. 6). When using spectral resolution of 100 000 and 50 000
the spectral features (CO lines in this case) are reconstructed.
When using a resolution of 10 000, the results are significantly
worse, and it becomes hard to distinguish between real and spurious features. While the recovered solution appears to have the
same spectral resolution (owing to similar amounts of regularization), the difference in the accuracy of the reconstruction depends only here on the resolution of the spectrograph (and thus
on the ability to differentiate exoplanetary contribution from telluric lines).
Since the telluric transmittance in NIR contains many spectral features, it is critical to know the telluric atmosphere to high
accuracy. In Sec. 4.2 we describe why high resolution can be
useful when obtaining telluric transmission spectra.
2. The simultaneous wavelength coverage of the spectrograph
is another important factor. Being able to detect a continuum
and absorption features simultaneously enables us to correct for
errors in planetary radius or estimated relative brightness decrease, which will shift the recovered spectrum along the eclipsing height axis. At least 0.1 µm is needed to target the most
favourable bands. With very high S/N, detecting a continuum is
possible even in narrow bands (such as in Fig. 6).
Being able to cover a significantly wider wavelength range
than 0.1 µm in a single exposure is very valuable. Observing
time is limited by the transit duration, and wide wavelength coverage makes it possible to search for several species simultaneously, as well as to identify what species is responsible for an
absorbing region from the shape and component spacing on the
feature.
Broader spectral coverage also helps with the continuum
normalization of observations. The quality of this step in stellar spectroscopy depends very much on the spectral type of
the target and the spectral domain. For cooler stars, molecular bands can prevent proper normalization based solely on the
science spectrum. An alternative approach is to measure relative
monochromatic throughput of telescope + spectrometer using a
well known spectrum. We have tested this techniques with the
solar reference spectrum in the optical and NIR using the observations of Vesta and Ganymede taken with the HARPS (ESO La
Silla) and the HIRES (Keck) spectrometers. Previous knowledge
of the result provided the throughput curves, thereby correcting
all small-scale instrumental and detector inhomogeneities to better than 0.5%. Then when applied to the science target, the remaining trend is only due to the difference in spectral type and
could be easily adjusted for.
We have chosen to focus on the NIR wavelength regime in
this paper. The main benefit to this is the numerous molecular
absorption bands located there. In hot-Jupiter atmospheres, we
expect to find species, such as H2 O, CO2 , CH4 , CO, H, H2 , O,
and OH (Miguel & Kaltenegger 2014). The expected chemical
composition of super-Earths is more uncertain. Extrapolating
from the atmospheres of rocky planets in out own solar system
indicates that they are likely to be very diverse. The H, K, L,
and M bands in NIR contain many molecular absorption bands
from important molecules, such as O3 , CO, CO2 , SO2 , CH4 , and
NH3 . In wavelengths longer than 2.5 µm, sky emission becomes
Article number, page 7 of 14

significant, making ground-based observations less competitive
with space observations. At shorter wavelengths, sky emission
is less significant. In Sec. 4.2 we propose dealing with sky emission using spectral synthesis. The S/N required to recover the
exoplanet transmission spectrum is high, so using wavelengths
longer than 3 µm will be problematic for all but the largest planets and brightest stars. We are therefore limited to the H and
K-bands (1.5 - 1.8 µm and 1.9 - 2.5 µm), where we have strong
absorption from CO2 , CO, CH4 , H2 O, CH4 , and NH3 . Observations in the J-band (1.1 - 1.4 µm) can also be valuable due to
the strong O2 absorption band around 1.27 µm, but unfortunately
very few other molecules have absorption bands in this region.
4.2. Model requirements

To test the method’s robustness, we examined how sensitive our
method is to the accuracy of measurements and model spectra.
We need telluric transmission spectra separately from the stellar
contribution. Observations consists of several short exposures
of the system as the planet moves across the stellar disk, and
for each of these exposures, the matching telluric transmittance
is needed. This must be very accurate and include changes in
the telluric atmosphere during the transit. This could be due to
changes in airmass as the star moves across the sky or it could
be due to changes in the relative abundances of specific species
(most notably water vapour).
Such changes will affect line strength and saturation, and
small errors in the telluric transmittance used in the data analysis can introduce spurious features in the recovered exoplanetary spectrum. For this reason we do not recommend using preand post-transit observations of telluric standards for obtaining
telluric transmittance, since it will be insensitive to changes in
the atmosphere during the transit. Dedicating time observing
a telluric standard at regular intervals during the transit is not
recommended either, because the standard must lie close to the
target where small changes in telluric transmittance will affect
results.
Since a transit event is limited in time, we want to avoid
spending time during the transit not observing the system itself. A more promising method of obtaining the telluric transmittance is synthetic spectra fitted to observations. Several tools
for synthesizing high-precision telluric transmission spectra exist, are under development (Seifahrt et al. 2010; Kausch et al.
2014), and can currently reproduce telluric absorption to an accuracy better than methods using telluric standard stars. Ideally
such spectral synthesizing includes sky emission to reduce the
need for nodding, thus maximizing the time spent observing the
transiting planet. In spectral regions where sky emission is significant, nodding might be required in order to produce a telluric
model with high enough accuracy. In such cases observation
time should take this into account, in our estimations we assume
sky emission is either negligible or can be modelled with high
accuracy.
To minimize the risk of including contributions from the exoplanet when fitting telluric transmittance to observations, we
need high enough spectral resolution to resolve the Doppler shift
due to differences in radial velocity between telluric and exoplanet atmosphere. Observations will originally be in the rest
frame of the detector. To avoid introducing additional errors,
telluric model spectra (and stellar models) should be fitted to
observations at this stage, before they are shifted and interpolated onto rest frame of the exoplanet. By using synthetic telluric spectra, we do not need to spend any of the limited observing time during the transit to observe telluric spectrum template,
Article number, page 8 of 14

but can instead spend all available time to observe the transiting exoplanet. Observations aimed at measuring the telluric atmosphere, by observing telluric standard stars or similar objects
with known spectral features along the same line of sight as the
transiting exoplanet, could still be carried out before and after
the transit in order to get the starting and ending conditions of
the atmosphere.
The accuracy of the telluric spectra must be high; systematic errors such as constant over- or under-estimation of telluric
features manifests as spurious features in the solution. To investigate the needed level of accuracy, we tested cases with imperfect telluric spectra when applying the data-analysis method.
First we used small non-systematic errors by alternating between
over- and under-estimation of the telluric transmittance by up to
±2%. We still manage to recover the same major molecular absorption bands as in the case-perfect telluric transmittance, but
artificial features were producedt in regions with strong telluric
absorption. The effects of systematic errors were also examined,
by always underestimating the telluric transmittance by up to
2% when performing the data analysis. In this case, the reconstruction is completely dominated by the errors in telluric transmittance, and the contribution from the exoplanet is no longer
visible. Both tests are shown in Fig. 7.
The flux spectrum of the host star is needed for the inversion. This can be measured before or after the transit. Its stability or variability can be monitored outside the transit. Specific
intensity spectra is more challenging. One approach is to use
synthetic spectra based on a custom-made model of stellar atmosphere. The model can be validated by comparing the flux
spectrum with observations outside transit. Limb darkening dependence is hard to verify. We examine the effects of errors in
specific intensity by using imperfect specific intensity spectra in
the data analysis. We use quadratic limb darkening equation in
one test and modelled specific intensities with effective temperature 5% higher than for the synthesis of observations. Results
can be seen in Fig. 8. In both cases, the major absorption bands
from the exoplanet are still recovered, but with limb darkening
equations, errors in the shape of the continuum are introduced,
while with imperfect model spectra, we only observe minor deviations from perfect intensity spectra. It is worth considering
that the case with limb darkening equations is close to optimal,
while the case with model spectra introduces deliberate errors.
Model spectra still produce better results, so we recommend the
use of model spectra over limb darkening equations.
Approximating the area-integrated specific intensity (i p and
ia in Eqs. 1) with the value at the centre of the planet or using
incorrect µ-values will produce effects similar to the test above.
In the cases presented here (hot-Jupiter in front of solar size star
and super-Earth in front of M dwarf), the errors in specific intensity spectra will be less than 1%, such small errors will not affect
the end results in any meaningful way.
Inhomogeneities on the stellar surface, such as starspots, can
potentially also cause artificial features in the recovered solution. If the transiting exoplanet crosses one or several starspots,
the light passing through the atmosphere will be significantly
different from the assumed specific intensity used in the data
analysis. The effects this has on the recovered exoplanet spectrum depends on the amount of exposures that are contaminated
and on the fraction of the exoatmosphere that covers the spots.
For young active stars, a significant fraction of the stellar surface can be covered by starspots. Transit spectroscopy will be
very complicated for these stars. For solar-like stars, the amount
of contamination from starspots will very likely be insignificant.
For the small fully convective stars, starspot patterns are largely

unknown and could cause problems depending of the size of individual spots and the fraction of the disk that is covered.
We performed a simple test where we simulate observations
of a transiting hot-Jupiter crossing a solar-like star, where we
replace some of the s pecific intensity spectra with the spectra
of sunspots (data from Pierce Solar Telescope). We then ignore
the spots when applying the data analysis method. For this test
we used spots of sizes comparable to the planet, and a rather
extreme case where the planet covers spots in 20% of the exposures (>50% of planet covered in 10% of exposures). Results
from this test can be seen in Fig. 9. We managed to recover the
same spectral features as when using a starspot free case. We
therefore do not expect any major issues concerning starspots
for solar-like stars. Ideally exposures contaminated by contribution from starspots should be removed from the data. The
photometry of the transits can detect the starspots if the spots are
large enough to produce a detectable brightness increase in the
transit light curve as the planet passes over it. This spot detection has successfully been demonstrated by Pont et al. (2007);
Carter et al. (2011b); Sing et al. (2011).
Photometric measurements taken simultaneous with the
spectroscopic measurements could help find the most problematic spots so that they can be removed from the data, at the same
time giving the exact start and end of the transit. Unocculted
starspots and other forms of stellar variability during the transit could potentially also cause problems, mainly in the form of
errors in size determination of the solid part of the exoplanet.

In Sec. 4.3 we explore the effects of errors in planetary radius.
Stars covered by a large number of star spots, enough to alter
the flux significantly, could also be problematic. In such cases
the stellar spectrum underneath the planet will be different from
the stellar flux, which would make synthetic specific intensity
spectra less accurate if using observed stellar flux to validate the
stellar model. For stars with solar-like spot coverage (less than
0.5% of the sun is covered by spots during solar maximum), this
effect would be insignificant.
4.3. Target selection and planet parameters

The data analysis method requires the size of the planet to be
known. This can be measured in the photometric transit light
curve. Errors and uncertainties in the size of the planet will have
two effects. First, this will shift the recovered spectrum along
the atmospheric height axis, down for over-estimations and up
for under-estimations. This effect is easily minimized by setting
the continuum of the solution to zero. The second effect of errors
in the size of the planet is the expected brightness decrease in the
star as the planet moves in front of the stellar disk (characterized
ν in Eq. 4). Errors in this can leave an imprint of stellar or telluric spectra in the recovered solution. This can be solved by
using our proposed way of calculating ν (Eq. 5), which corrects
for errors in planetary size. Reasonably small errors in planetary size will only have a weak effect on the relative strength of
absorption features. We show this by simulating two cases, one

planetary radius, which are the results after setting continuum to

Planetary systems come in many different sizes and brightnesses. The relative projected area of the planet’s semitransparent atmosphere to the area of the stellar disk is the most important factor for the required S/N for transit spectroscopy. This can
differ by a factor of 10 000 between the most extreme cases. We
applied the method to simulations of a multitude of different size
ratios. To make it easier to account for different transit durations
and observations during several transits, this was converted into
S/N per resolution element of all exposures combined (see Table
3). This is for the idealized case and that eclipsing height of the
atmosphere strongly affects the required S/N.
The constantly growing body of known exoplanets includes
many suitable candidates for transit spectroscopy of this type.
In Table 4 we list some the most advantages exoplanets for observations of them. Data was taken from the Exoplanet Orbit
Database (Wright et al. 2011).

Another potential problem is the case where there is no atmosphere (or a completely transparent or opaque atmosphere in all
measured wavelengths). We investigated the ability of the dataanalysis method to distinguish between a planet with a semitransparent atmosphere and a planet with no atmosphere at all
by simulation observations of the two cases, and then applied the
data analysis to both cases in exactly the same way. Results are
shown in Fig. 11. In the case with no atmosphere, the deviations
from a flat continuum at height 0 are mainly due to the inverse
method trying to fit the noise. In this case we cannot distinguish
a planet with no atmosphere from a planet with a thin atmosphere (eclipsing height less than 100 km). This upper limit can
be reduced with less noisy observations (or observations from
several transits). An atmosphere dominated by Rayleigh scattering in the observed wavelengths is similar to the case with no
atmosphere. The needed level of precision to measure the small
changes across the wavelengths range due to Rayleigh scattering
is difficult to achieve with ground-based telescopes and could
easily be mistaken for a planet with no atmosphere using this
method. Here other observational techniques would be more appropriate, such as low-resolution space-based spectroscopy.

erage usually have spectral resolution well under 10 000, making observations with this method mostly pointless. There are,
however, a few current instruments just at the lower edge of the
needed requirements and several upcoming instruments that will
be able to deliver observations with sufficient quality within the
coming years.
The two best-suited current spectrographs are NIRSPEC
(McLean et al. 1998) at Keck II and IRCS (Tokunaga et al.
1998) at the Subaru telescope. NIRSPEC has a spectral resolution of 25 000 and a simultaneous wavelength coverage of
about about 0.2 µm. IRCS has similar capabilities, a slightly
lower spectral resolution of 20 000, but the simultaneous wavelength coverage is better, around 0.4 µm at the relevant wavelengths. These instruments are at the lower edge of the instrumental requirements, and characterization of gas giants transiting the brightest stars should be possible with these instruments.
We show this by simulating observations from one transit of the

an instrument with spectral resolving power R = 20 000 at an 8
m telescope. Results shown in Fig. 12.
While these current instruments should be able to characterize the large planets transiting the brightest stars, reaching superEarths will not be possible unless large amounts of observing
time is dedicated to this task. Driven largely by the need for precise radial velocity measurements of cool dwarf stars to detect
Earth-size exoplanets, a number of upcoming high-resolution
NIR spectrographs are currently planned. Many of these will
be located at 4 m class telescopes, which will have a hard time
reaching the needed S/N for transit spectroscopy. A few of the
proposed or in-progress instruments will, however, be located at
bigger telescopes.
One such instrument is the HZPF (Mahadevan et al. 2010),
a proposed NIR high-resolution spectrograph, which will have a
spectral resolution of 80 000, a wavelength coverage of 0.9 - 1.7
µm in a single exposure, and the photon collecting power of the
Hobby-Eberly Telescope’s (HET) primary 9 m mirror. At first
glance, this instrument seems very promising, however, HET
cannot be pointed towards any part of the sky, and one must
instead wait for a star with a transiting planet to pass over the
telescope at exactly the right time. This keeps HET from being
well-suited to observing rare and time-limited phenomena like
exoplanetary transits. Combing observations from several transits would also be very hard, which makes recovering exoplanetary contributions from all but the largest planets impossible.
The Subaru telescope already has a NIR spectrograph capable of characterizing the most favourable cases (IRCS). There
are, however, plans to add new high-resolution options to this
telescope. IRCS-HRU (Terada et al. 2008) will increase the
maximum possible resolution of IRCS up to 70 000 in wavelengths longer than 1.4 µm. Another instrument, specialized
in NIR radial velocity measurements is the IRD (Tamura et al.
2012), which will have a resolution of 70 000 and a simultaneous
spectral coverage of 1.2 - 1.85 µm. Finally there is WINERED
(Yasui et al. 2008) with a resolution of 100 000 and simultaneous
spectral coverage 0.9 - 1.35 µm. All of these instrument have the
needed requirements for exoplanetary transit spectroscopy with
the method presented here, and they might even be able to reach
some of the more favourable super-Earths if enough observing
time has been granted.

The current high-resolution NIR spectrograph at VLT,
CRIRES, suffers from a very limited spectral coverage in a single exposure ( 0.05 µm). There is a proposed upgrade for this
instrument, CRIRES+ (Oliva et al. 2012). This instrument will
have the same spectral resolution (100 000) and a significantly
increased spectral coverage owing to the addition of a crossdispersed mode. With the large photon collecting power of
VLT’s 8 m primary mirror and covering most of the Y, J, H, K, or
M bands in a single exposure, observations from this instrument
will be able to characterize many giant planets transiting bright
stars. One should also be able to reach super-Earths transiting
the very small stars if combing several transits. Advantageous
super-Earths for these types of observations are, however, hard
to find within reach of Paranal observatory (mainly due to all Kepler objects being located too far north), and currently the only
known super-Earth where CRIRES+ observations will be sufficient for reproducing the transmission spectrum reliably is GJ
1214 b.
The NIR spectrographs for the next generation of 30 m class
telescopes are even more impressive. For the 39 m European
Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT), the current idea is HIRES;
a combined optical and NIR spectrograph with resolving power

6. Observations
To test the reduction procedure on real data we applied the
data analysis method to CRIRES observations of HD 209458 b
(Snellen et al. 2010). Data consists of 51 spectra (30 during transit) of a single three-hour transit of HD 209458 b (see Table 4),
targeting a CO band around 2.30 to 2.35 µm. We only used data
from Detectors 2 and 3 owing to poor data quality in Detectors
1 and 4. In this region, there are few stellar lines, which reduces
the need for accurate specific intensity spectra. Instead we used
quadratic limb darkening law to model changes in stellar intensity as function of limb distance. Flux spectra are taken from
the out-of-transit observations. Model telluric spectra were created using similar procedure to those described by Snellen et al.
(2010), except that we do not assign zero weight to the pixels in
which we expect exoplanetary signal; instead, we increase the
weight of pixels during out-of-transit exposures.
Owing to the short wavelength range, we cannot use the optimal regularization parameter based on data quality and expected
signal strength, because doing so would result in a flat featureless solution. Instead we decrease regularization to what would
be appropriate for recovering individual absorption lines in spite
of the data not having the needed quality to recover individual
lines. The recovered solution is shown in Fig. 14, along with
the placement of the CO lines previously detected in the same
data set. The solution appears noisy, and only a few individual
CO lines seem to be reconstructed. From this data it is not possible to directly identify the absorbers in the atmosphere of HD
209458 b. However, analysis of multiple CO lines will increase
the signal. Stacking the available CO lines (ignoring the lines
at 2317.7 and 2323.6 nm due to several bad pixels close to line
cores) and normalizing by the average value in the wings reveals

Normalized line depth

of at least 100 000 and simultaneous wavelength coverage of
1.0 - 2.7 µm. With the large photon collecting area of a 39 m
mirror, observations during a single transits corresponds to observing more than 20 successive transits with an 8 m telescope.
This makes characterizations of exoplanets orbiting faint stars
feasible, as well as recovering high-resolution spectra from large
planets around bright stars. (Results could be similar to Fig. 6.)
The transit spectroscopy of Earth-size planets orbiting solar-like
stars would still be hard because of the extremely small fraction
of the stellar disk that is covered by the planetary atmosphere.
To show the power of the photon collecting area of E-ELT, combined with a high-resolution spectrograph such as HIRES, we
simulated observations of a single transit of GJ 1214 b (see Table
4, assuming a atmospheric height of 150 km). This small planet
orbits a faint star and would require observations of several transits with smaller telescopes to reach sufficient S/N, but with a
39 m mirror one would able to detect the main absorption bands
from observations during a single transit. Results from this test
are shown in Fig. 13, including comparison with observations
with a 8 m telescope.
The Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) also has planned a highresolution NIR spectrograph, NIRES. This echelle spectrograph
will be able to achieve spectral resolution up to 100 000 and
will operate in 1 - 5 µm. A cross-dispersed mode will enable observations from 1.0 - 2.5 µm simultaneously; as a result,
apart from a smaller photon collecting area, the performance of
NIRES will be very similar to E-ELT’s HIRES. However, since
the TMT is planned to be built on Mauna Kea, the telescopes will
have access to the northern sky, where currently the majority of
the favourable super-Earths and Earth-size exoplanets for transit
spectroscopy are located.

only 1% shows absorption at the core of the line stronger than
what we get from combing positions of CO lines.

7. Conclusions
The data analysis method presented here makes the recovery
of exoplanetary atmospheric transmittance spectrum using highresolution observations of transiting exoplanets robust. There
are several advantages to this method over the classical narrow
band filter photometry approach. One of the most important
aspects is the interpretation of the data, which becomes more
straightforward thanks to higher spectral resolution and a wide
wavelength coverage. Given the estimates of the physical conditions in the planetary atmosphere (pressure, temperature regime,
UV-flux, etc.), a first approximation of chemical composition
could be made directly from the recovered spectrum, without
much need for atmospheric models.
Molecular species responsible for strong absorption features
(such as H2 0, CO2 , CO, CH4 ) could be identified from the shape,
placement, line spacing, and relative strength of recovered absorption bands. With broad enough spectral coverage to detect multiple absorption bands from a single molecular species,
false detections could be minimized, and they would enable us to
distinguish between species with overlapping absorption bands.
From such a first approximation of the chemical composition,
the next step would be to create a grid of planetary models with a
range of relative abundances and temperature and pressure structures. Finding the model with the best fit to observations could
now be made with fewer uncertainties, mainly due to the first approximation of chemical composition already made, but also due
to the large number of data points that come with good spectral
resolution and wide wavelength coverage.

This method requires a special set of observations. To optimize observations, many short exposures (around 1-2 minutes)
of the star are needed while the planet transits. Along with this,
accurate stellar flux spectrum (without transiting planet), specific intensities and telluric transmittance, corresponding to each
individual exposure, are all needed. In order not to reduce the
observing time of the actual target, which is limited by the transit duration, we propose using synthetic telluric spectra fitted
to observations. We estimate that the requirements of instruments and observational targets are able to produce observations
with sufficient quality. Instruments need high spectral resolution
(>20 000), good simultaneous spectral coverage (>0.1 µm), and
a large photon collecting area (>8 m).
We have identified potentially problematic issues. Large errors in telluric transmission spectra and stellar specific intensity
can present as artificial features in the recovered exoplanet spectrum. We propose ways to minimize these problems and show
that even under non-optimal conditions recovering the exoplanet
spectrum is still possible.
For target selection, we defined the important aspects of targets and produced a short list of the most advantageous starplanet systems known to date (November 2014). The critical
property of a target when performing transit spectroscopy is the
relative size of the planet to its star. This makes the atmospheres
of large gas giants generally much easier to recover. For spectral characterization of Jupiter-size exoplanets, this data analysis
method using observations with high-resolution spectrometers at
8 m class telescopes seem promising. Recovering transmission
spectra with this method will be possible once enough instrumentshave been constructed for most known gas giants orbiting
bright stars. The chemical composition of these worlds might
give us an insight into their origins.
Smaller planets, super-Earths, and Earth-size planets are
more difficult to characterize. We expect to be able to distinguish
spectral features originating in their atmospheres given sufficient
observing time, accurate stellar models, and advantageous properties of the host star (small and bright). Unfortunately, very few
favourable candidates are known, and most are located out of
the reach of two of the most promising upcoming instruments,
CRIRES+ at VLT and HIRES at E-ELT. However, the success of
the Kepler space missions has demonstrated that the chances of
finding observationally advantageous super-Earths on the southern hemisphere is high, so all we need are dedicated space-based
transit surv eys.
