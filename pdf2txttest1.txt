ABSTRACT

Context. After many attempts over more than a decade, high-resolution spectroscopy has recently delivered its first detections of
molecular absorption in exoplanet atmospheres, both in transmission and thermal emission spectra. Targeting the combined signal
from individual lines in molecular bands, these measurements use variations in the planet radial velocity to disentangle the planet
signal from telluric and stellar contaminants.
Aims. In this paper we apply high resolution spectroscopy to probe molecular absorption in the day-side spectrum of the bright
transiting hot Jupiter HD 189733b.
Methods. We observed HD 189733b with the CRIRES high-resolution near-infrared spectograph on the Very Large Telescope during
three nights, targeting possible absorption from carbon monoxide, water vapour, methane and carbon dioxide, at 2.0 and 2.3 µm.
Results. We detect a 5-σ absorption signal from CO at a contrast level of ∼4.5×10−4 with respect to the stellar continuum, revealing
−1
the planet orbital radial velocity at 154+4
−3 km s . This allows us to solve for the planet and stellar mass in a similar way as for stellar
+0.058
+0.068
MJup . No significant absorption is detected from H2 O, CO2
eclipsing binaries, resulting in Ms = 0.846−0.049 M⊙ and M p = 1.162−0.039
or CH4 and we determined upper limits on their line contrasts here.
Conclusions. The detection of CO in the day-side spectrum of HD 189733b can be made consistent with the haze layer proposed to
explain the optical to near-infrared transmission spectrum if the layer is optically thin at the normal incidence angles probed by our
observations, or if the CO abundance is high enough for the CO absorption to originate from above the haze. Our non-detection of
CO2 at 2.0 µm is not inconsistent with the deep CO2 absorption from low resolution NICMOS secondary eclipse data in the same
wavelength range. If genuine, the absorption would be so strong that it blanks out any planet light completely in this wavelength
range, leaving no high-resolution signal to be measured.

1. Introduction
The extrasolar planet (exoplanet) transiting the K-star HD
189733 is one of the most studied exoplanets to date, since
the brightness of the system (V=7.75 mag) allows the detailed study of its atmosphere through transit and secondary
eclipse measurements. Optical transmission measurements show
a steady decrease of the effective planet radius from 0.3 to
1 µm, which is thought to be due to Rayleigh scattering by
a high altitude haze layer (Pont et al. 2008; Sing et al. 2009;
Pont et al. 2012). The Rayleigh slope seems only interrupted by
an absorption signal from sodium at 0.59 µm (Redfield et al.
2008; Huitson et al. 2012). There is a strong ungoing debate
on whether this Rayleigh scattering signal continues in the
near-infrared. Analysis of HST NICMOS spectroscopic observations by (Swain et al. 2008) show absorption signatures
from water and methane. However, reanalysis of the same
data (Gibson et al. 2011), narrow band NICMOS observations
(Sing et al. 2009), and HST data from WFC3 (Gibson et al.
2012) show no clear evidence for molecular features and suggest
⋆

Observatory (186.C-0289)

that Rayleigh scattering dominates the transmission spectrum up
to 2.5 µm.
Numerous secondary eclipse measurements (e.g.
Deming et al. 2006; Grillmair et al. 2008; Charbonneau et al.
2008; Swain et al. 2009) have placed constraints on the
day-side temperature structure and trace gas abundances (e.g.
Madhusudhan & Seager 2009; Line et al. 2012; Lee et al. 2012).
In addition, phase curve observations from the Spitzer Space
Telescope suggest that the hottest point in the planet atmosphere
is shifted with respect to the sub-stellar point, indicating strong
longitudinal circulation in the atmosphere (Knutson et al. 2009,
2012). However, also several secondary eclipse measurements
are controversial. Swain et al. (2010) claim the presence of
an enormous emission feature at 3.25 µm from ground-based
observations, interpreted as non-LTE emission from methane.
The same team (Waldmann et al. 2012) confirmed this result
with new data, in addition to showing similarly strong emission
features at 2.3 µm. However, Mandell et al. (2011) see no sign
of the L-band emission in NIRSPEC data, with upper limits
40 times smaller than the claimed non-LTE methane signal,
and suggest that imperfect correction for telluric water is the
source of the feature claimed by Swain et al. In any case, the
1

unconventional observation and data analysis preformed by
Swain et al. and Waldmann et al. needs to be validated using
other techniques.
The current measurements of the day-side of HD 189733b
are taken at low spectral resolution at best, with most observations being from broad-band photometry. The limited spectral
resolution of the available measurements result in a large ambiguity in atmospheric composition (e.g. Madhusudhan & Seager
2009; Line et al. 2012; Lee et al. 2012) and temperature structure (Pont et al. 2012).
Recently, high resolution spectroscopy has delivered its
first detections of molecular absorption: carbon monoxide
was detected in the transmission spectrum of HD209458b
(Snellen et al. 2010) and in the thermal dayside spectrum of τ
Bo¨otis b (Brogi et al. 2012; Rodler et al. 2012). These observations, conducted with the CRyogenic high-resolution InfraRed
Echelle Spectrograph (CRIRES Kaeufl et al. 2004) on the Very
Large Telescope (VLT) at a resolution of R≈100,000 target the
combined signal from individual lines in the CO 2.3 µm molecular band. The large variation in the planet velocity is used to
disentangle its spectral features from the telluric and stellar contamination. This also allows the determination of the orbital velocity of the planet, and therefore the orbital inclination and true
planet mass in the case of non-transiting planets. Recent results
from thermal dayside spectroscopy of 51 Pegasi b (Brogi et al.
2013) are somewhat ambiguous. Although the first two nights
of data show a combined ∼6-σ detection from carbon monoxide
plus water, no signal is detected in the third night. Although the
signal on the third night was expected to be slightly weaker due
to the reduced quality of the data and contamination by stellar
lines, a complete absence was not expected based on the first
two nights. This would mean that either some yet unknown systematics is affecting the data, or that time variability (by e.g.
global weather patterns), plays a large role in the atmosphere of
this object.
High-resolution spectroscopy has been attempted before for
HD 189733 b. Using two nights of Keck/NIRSPEC observations
at a resolution of ∼25,000, Barnes et al. (2010) identify a possible planet signal using a deconvolution method. However, they
could not make a strong claim due to the low significance of the
result. Very recently, Rodler et al. (2013) revisited this dataset
and claim a ∼3-σ detection of CO lines in HD 189733b.
Here, we present high-resolution CRIRES observarions of
HD 189733 at 2.0 and 2.3 µm targeting absorption not only from
CO, but also from CO2 , H2 O and CH4 in the planet’s day-side
spectrum. Section 2 describes the observations and data analysis
and Section 3 the cross-correlation procedure used to combine
the signal from the individual lines. Section 4 describes the results, which are discussed in Section 5.

2. Observations and data analysis
We observed HD 189733b as part of a large programme (ESO
programme 186.C-0289, Snellen et al. 2011) to probe molecular
signatures in hot Jupiter atmospheres with CRIRES. CRIRES
consists of four 1024×512-pixel Aladdin II detectors, separated
by small gaps of roughly 100 pixels. The Multi-Application
Curvature Adaptive Optics system (MACAO, Arsenault et al.
2003) was employed to maximise the throughput of the slit.
Here, we use data taken during three nights, conducted at two
wavelength settings, centred at 2.0 and 2.3 µm. The data were
taken over a planet orbital phase-range near but not during secondary eclipse to maximise the illumination of the planet and the
planet’s change in radial velocity (see Table 1 for more details).

All observations used a 0.2” slit, resulting in a spectral resolution of R≈100,000, and the star was nodded along the slit in an
ABBA pattern to subtract the background. The spectra around
2.0 µm contain possible planet lines of H2 O and CO2 , whereas
the 2.3 µm region can be used to probe CO, H2 O and CH4 .
On 13 July data was taken with an integration time of 4×15
seconds per nodding position. On 29 July the integration time
was 5×20 seconds and on 21 August 4×20 seconds. All three
observations spanned roughly 5 hours each.
The raw data was flat-fielded, background-subtracted, and
optimally extracted using the standard CRIRES pipeline (version
1.11.0). The data from the three nights, for each of the four detectors, were analysed separately. In each case, a 1024×N matrix
was constructed from the N spectra. Bad columns in the matrix
(corresponding to certain pixels in the spectra) were identified
by taking the standard deviation of each column and finding >5σ outliers. These bad columns (of the order of 20 per detector)
were masked in the rest of the analysis. Further individual bad
pixels were replaced by spline-interpolated values.
The next step in the data reduction was to align all spectra
onto a common wavelength grid. For this purpose we calculated
a template telluric transmission spectrum with water, carbon
dioxode and methane lines from HITRAN 2008 (Rothman et al.
2009) using line-by-line calculations with a single model layer
and pressures, temperatures and gas concentrations relevant to
Paranal. Since HD 189733A has significant CO lines in its spectrum, we also calculated CO absorption lines at the stellar temperature using HITEMP absorption data (Rothman et al. 2010)
and scaled these relative to the telluric lines by comparisons with
the data. We then Doppler-shifted the stellar CO lines according to the Earth’s velocity, the known stellar systematic velocity and its planet-induced radial velocity variation (Triaud et al.
2009), and combined them with the telluric spectrum. This was
then correlated with each measured spectrum to find the bestfitting second-order polynomial correction on our initial guess of
the wavelengths of each pixel, where the polynomial represents
a wavelength-dependent shift. Finally, the spectra were splineinterpolated onto a common wavelength grid.
Before we searched for molecular features in the data using
the cross-correlation technique, we first needed to remove telluric and stellar signatures. The telluric lines are static in position, but vary in strength due to changes in the geometric airmass
and variations in the water vapour content of the atmosphere.
The stellar lines are invariable in time to a high level, but slightly
change in position during the night due to variations in the radial
velocity component of the Paranal observatory with respect to
the star (mainly caused by the Earth’s rotation).
In this work we analyse the data in a somewhat different way
than previously (Snellen et al. 2011; Brogi et al. 2012, 2013) to
explore new ways of reducing this type of data. We also performed the analysis with the previous method and found compatible results (see Section 4.1). Instead of removing the telluric

de Kok et al.: CO in the atmosphere of HD 189733b

contamination by fitting the columns in the matrix first with the
geometric airmass and subsequently with the residual signals
present in the strongest telluric lines, here we use singular value
decompositions (SVD, e.g. Kalman 1996). For this we used the
algorithm available in IDL. The SVD decomposes a matrix A
into the following matrices:
A = UWV T ,

(1)

where U is the matrix of left singular vectors, W a (by definition) diagonal matrix of singular values and V the matrix of
right singular vectors. In our case the matrix A represents the array of spectra on a single detector, with the number of pixels and
number of spectra as dimensions. The right singular vectors are
the eigenvectors and the left singular vectors, scaled by the singular values, indicate how each of the eigenvectors are weighted
to form each observed spectrum. A convenient property of the
SVD is that matrix A can be approximated in an optimal way using only the largest few singular values, and setting the smaller
singular values to zero (e.g. Andrews & Patterson 1975). Here,
we do the reverse and set the largest singular values to zero to
remove the signals that are static with time while affecting the
moving planet signal as little as possible. Fig. 1 shows an example of a matrix of spectra (detector 2 on the night of 13 July
2011) with progressive subtraction of the singular values for detector 2 at 2.3 µm. Examples of the left and right singular vectors
are shown in Figs. 2 and 3.
The left singular vectors corresponding to the first two singular values of the 2.3 µm data show clear correlations with the
signal level in the continuum and the airmass for all four detectors (see Figs. 2 and 4). Hence, the subtraction of the first two
singular values is in effect very similar to the first steps used
by Snellen et al. (2010) and Brogi et al. (2012, 2013). Also the
third left singular vector is very similar for all four detectors.
Its corresponding eigenvector (Fig. 3) indicates it is related to
shifts and/or broadening of the lines in the spectrum and its behaviour with time is somewhat similar to parameters relevant to
the adaptive optics performance (see Fig. 4). The only parameter
in the headers that was similar to the fourth left singular vector
is one of the temperature sensors in the instrument. The physical
correspondances of these third and fourth left singular vectors is
far from conclusive, with correlation coefficients of around 0.5
between these vectors and the quantities plotted in Fig. 4, but
it does highlight the diagnostic value of the SVDC for tracking
potential systematic effects in the measurements.
As a final step, we divide each column of the array of spectra
by the square of the standard deviation. This prevents the crosscorrelation analysis to be dominated by very noisy pixels.

3. Correlation analysis
We cross-correlated each reduced spectrum with model spectra of exoplanet atmospheres with Doppler shifts ranging from
-200 to +200 km/s relative to the expected planet radial velocity.
Orbital parameters of the system were taken from Triaud et al.
(2009). In order to scan the parameter space and check for potential spurious correlation signals, we also performed our calculations for a wide range of amplitudes of the radial velocity
of the planet, K p (50-200 km s−1 ). We assumed a circular orbit
throughout the paper, which is reasonable given that the maximum offset in planet radial velocity for its possible small eccentricity (see Triaud et al. 2009) is smaller than the velocity resolution of CRIRES.

Fig. 1. Example of stellar and telluric signal removal: the array
of spectra (in ADU per second) for detector 2 at 2.3 µm on 13
July 2011 after setting the first n singular values to zero, with n
being indicated above the panels.

The model spectra are the result of line-by-line calculations
using a range of parameterised pressure-temperature structures
(see below), H2 -H2 collision-induced absorption (Borysow et al.
2001; Borysow 2002) and absorption from a single trace
gas. Line data for the trace gases are taken from HITEMP
2010 for H2 O and CO (Rothman et al. 2010), HITRAN 2008
for CH4 (Rothman et al. 2009) and HITEMP 1995 for CO2
(Rothman et al. 1995). A Voigt line-shape is used for calculation of the absorption. The atmospheric temperatures at pressures higher than 0.1 bar, where we take a temperature of 1350
K, are made to follow the best fitting temperature profiles of
Madhusudhan & Seager (2009) and the temperature at a lower
pressure p1 is varied from 500 to 1500 K in steps of 500 K.
As such, we also included the option of weak thermal inversions at high altitudes. Between 0.1 and p1 bar a constant lapse
rate (i.e. the rate of temperature change with log pressure) is as3

of 100.5. At pressures lower than p1 a uniform temperature is
assumed. Volume mixing ratios of the gases ranged from 10−6 10−3 in multiplication steps of 100.5.
The correlation analysis was performed for each of the four
detectors separately. To combine the correlation signals obtained
from different spectra and detectors we first determined how to
weigh their contributions. We did this by inserting an artificial
planet signal in the wavelength-aligned data for the system velocity and K p under consideration, and perform the same data
reduction as the original data. If the data with inserted signal
gives a large increase in correlation value for a particular spectrum, this spectrum is thus expected to give a high signal also
in the original data. Hence, the increase of the correlation when
inserting the artificial planet signal can be used as a weighing
factor to favour spectra or detectors for which a larger signal is
expected. The correlation values for each spectrum and detector

are multiplied by this increase of correlation, and added together
to form the total correlation signal.
In the correlation analysis for CO, there are still some residuals originating from the stellar spectrum. This is not surprising,
since the star’s radial velocity slightly changes with time due to
the Earth’s rotation and the star has significant CO lines in its
spectrum. Fortunately, the velocities of the planet are at least 20
km/s offset from that of the star for the phases observed, so the
strongest stellar residuals do not affect the correlation signal of
the planet. When combining the correlation signals of the different spectra, we mask the velocities that are within 5 km/s of the
stellar velocity after the cross-correlation. Note that this does not
significantly affect our cross-correlation signals at the expected
planet velocity, but only within the region of the expected stellar
signals.
As more singular values are subtracted from the data, parts
of the planet signal may also be removed. Hence, there is an optimum number of subtractions that will lead to the best recovery
of the planet signal. We tested this effect by again inserting artificial planet signals and evaluating the correlation signal for the
different numbers of reduced singular values. Fig. 5 illustrates
how the planet signal in a single detector first becomes apparent
when the stellar and telluric signals are removed, and then slowly
disappears as more and more singular values are removed. The
slow drop of correlation with more subtracted singular values
rises from the fact that there is only very little power in each
of these higher singular values. The correlation as a function of
number of subtracted singular values is actually very similar to
the correlation of the data without inserted signal, but the correlation values are higher. For each detector, we chose the number
of singular values to subtract according to the highest correlation of the inserted signal with respect to the correlation noise,
when combined over the entire night. Fig. 5 also illustrates what
happens to the signal if negative planet signals are inserted. Such
a negative signal would correspond to spectra with lines seen in
emission instead of absorption.

Our correlation analysis yields a detection of carbon monoxide
at 2.3 µm, which is presented below. No significant signals are
detcted for the other bands and molecules, of which the implications are discussed in Section 4.2.

Brightness temperature (K)

The cross-correlation assuming different system velocities and
values of the planet radial velocity K p for our best CO template
are shown in Fig. 6. The best CO template itself is shown in
Fig. 7. A positive correlation value (black) means in this case
that the CO lines are apparent in absorption, as in Fig. 7, indicating a non-inverted temperature profile over the probed pressure range. The correlation shows a 5.0-σ maximum at the expected system velocity, within the range of K p expected from the
measured radial velocity of the star and its estimated mass from
spectral modelling (Triaud et al. 2009). The significance was estimated by the peak cross-correlation value divided by the noise
in the cross-correlation values in Fig. 6 at system velocities away
from the planet signal. The signal is the combination of all four
detectors, although detector 1 does not show a clear signal. Note
however that detector 1 has a low weight, since artificially injected planet spectra give only very faint retrieved signals. This
is consistent with the CO spectrum, which shows less lines in
the wavelength range covered by detector 1.

and Vsys = -2 km s , both consistent with the literature values
for the orbital and stellar parameters of the system (Triaud et al.
2009). We estimated the statistical significance of the signal
in several ways. First of all, we tested how the distribution of
cross-correlation values as calculated for the 110 spectra compare to a Gaussian distribution. A histogram of the correlation
values as obtained from detectors 2-4 is shown in Fig. 8. The
interval of the system velocities over shich the histrogram was
plotted was chosen such that the area of the stellar signal was
avoided and a large sample was obtainted. The best fit of the
histogram to a Gaussian distribution is overplotted, showing a
very good agreement. A further analysis of the quantiles of this

distribution (Fig. 9) shows it exhibits no significant deviation
from Gaussianity. Only detector 1 shows some non-Gaussian
behaviour using the optimal number of singular values, which
improved when more singular values were subtracted. Since we
did not find a significant signal in this detector and it is weighted
very lightly compared to the other detectors, and because the extra singular values effectively only remove very little of the data,
the additional subtraction of the singular values had no impact
on the final result.

An additional test we performed was the Welch T-test (Welch
1947), comparing the planet signal distribution with the correlation distribution away from the expected planet velocities (see
Fig. 10). Unfortunately, we have far less spectra available compared to Brogi et al. (2012, 2013), who performed the same test,
so the sampling of the correlations at the planet velocity is worse
here. Nevertheless, we can reject the null-hypothesis that the two
samples are drawn from the same distribution at a 4.2-σ confidence level.
Our measurements are not sensitive to the continuum level
of the planet spectrum, since we remove any broadband signal in
our data analysis. We are only sensitive to the depths of the narrow absorption lines, which are the parts of the planet spectrum
that show the Doppler shift. We determined the line contrast (the
depth of the deepest lines with respect to the continuum, divided
by the stellar flux) by inserting the model that gives the strongest
signal times different (negative) scaling factors (see Section 3)
until a significance value of 0±1 σ was reached at the planet

velocity for all four detectors combined. The line contrast for
the deepest CO lines determined in this way is (4.5±0.9)×10−4,
which corresponds roughly to the signal from the template spectrum (see Fig. 7). This is the value for the model spectra and does
not include the convolution to the instrument resolution. The line
contrast including convolution gives a value of (3.4±0.7)×10−4.
This line contrast can be interpreted as the difference of the line
cores with respect to the broadband continuum and can be used
as an additional constraint on the temperature profile and CO
concentration (see the discussion in Section 5). The continuum
level will be close to the broadband secondary eclipse depth
around 2.3 µm for this transiting planet.
Using the data analysis method we presented previously
(Snellen et al. 2010; Brogi et al. 2012, 2013) we found a 4.8-σ
detection of the CO signal, which is consistent with the results
presented here. Hence, either method can be used equally well,
although the method presented here is perhaps less ad hoc and
allows for a more objective treatment of the data.
4.2. Upper limits for CO2 ,H2 O and CH4

Besides CO, we also searched for signals from H2 O and CH4
in the 2.3 µm data, and CO2 and H2 O in the 2.0 µm data, but
did not find a significant signal. We determined upper limits of
the line contrast by inserting inverted models until a significance
value of -3σ was reached at the planet velocity for all four detectors combined. We used the same number of singular values as
for the CO analysis. The resulting upper limits of the maximum
model (unconvolved) line contrasts is 2.8×10−3 for H2 O and
8.3×10−4 for CH4 . The latter is comparable to the value of the
medium-resolution secondary eclipse depth of 8×10−4 , i.e. the
total planet-to-star flux contrast at these wavelengths, as measured with NICMOS on the HST by Swain et al. (2009). Since
the continuum level would be close to the medium-resolution
planet/star flux contrast, this would imply that the flux in the
CH4 lines would have to drop to zero for them to be detectable at
the determined upper limit of the line depth. The contrast of the
best-fitting CO lines is ∼ 4.5×10−4, so CH4 would have to be significantly more abundant than CO for this to happen, given their
similar line strengths in this region. Also, the upper atmosphere
of HD 189733b would need to be extremely cold (of the order

de Kok et al.: CO in the atmosphere of HD 189733b

of a few hundred Kelvin). Neither of them is very likely (see
e.g. Madhusudhan & Seager 2009; Moses et al. 2013). Hence,
the upper limit on the line contrast of CH4 does not constrain
the abundance in a meaningful way if the measured mediumresolution planet-to-star contrast is correct.
Although we have collected two nights of data at 2.0 µm,
we were less sensitive to atmospheric signals in this wavelength
range due to a combination of more telluric absorption and a
smaller contrast between the planet and the star. Fig. 11 shows
an example spectrum of the 2.0 µm data. The spectra on detectors 1 and 4 are dominated by telluric CO2 lines, greatly reducing
the potential for retrieving exoplanet signals. In detectors 2 and 3
also water lines are evident. In general, the telluric transmission
is significantly lower than around 2.3 µm. For this wavelength
setting we ignored detector 4 due to the much lower count level.
The SVD analysis could reduce the systematic signals down to
similar levels as in Fig. 1. Again, models with varying temperature profiles and volume mixing ratios of H2 O and CO2 were inserted with K p = 154 km s−1 to find 3-σ upper limits of 8.7×10−4
for H2 O and 1.8×10−3 for CO2 .

4.3. Planet system parameters

Since we now have a measure of the velocity and the orbital inclination of both the star and the planet around their common
barycentre, model-independent estimates of their masses can be
obtained in the same way as has been done for stellar eclipsing binaries for more than a century (e.g. Torres et al. 2010).
Using the values and uncertainties from Triaud et al. (2009, see
Table 2) for the amplitude of the stellar radial velocity variations, planet orbital inclination and period, we determine a
stellar mass of M s = 0.846+0.068
−0.049 M⊙ and a planet mass of
M p = 1.162+0.058

repeated on both sides of the secondary eclipse (phases higher

discussed in Section 5.

5. Discussion and conclusions
Using high resolution spectra from CRIRES on the VLT at
orbital phases between 0.38-0.48, we detect carbon monoxide in the day-side atmosphere of HD 189733b at a 5-σ
significance. From Spitzer data the presence of CO was already suspected (Barman 2008; D´esert et al. 2009) , although
more wider scans of the parameter space revealed no useful constraints on CO based on the Spitzer secondary eclipse
data alone (Madhusudhan & Seager 2009). HST/NICMOS secondary eclipse data do show large CO volume mixing ratios (∼10−4 -10−2 ) (Swain et al. 2009; Madhusudhan & Seager
2009; Lee et al. 2012), although past NICMOS results have
been received with some scepticism (e.g. Gibson et al. 2011).
Waldmann et al. (2012) claim to detect a strong planet emission feature at 2.3 µm using low-resolution groundbased spectroscopy, similar to the controversial signal found at 3.2 µm by
Swain et al. (2010), and also suggest it could be non-LTE emission. Due to the fact that no proper physical model exists yet for
this emission, we could not perform a detailed search for this
emission in our data. However, no obvious high-resolution signal, expected from the ∼2x10−3 low resolution signal seen by
Waldmann et al., is present in our data. Figure 1 indicates that
single lines cannot be seen above the 1% level in our data.
The CRIRES measurements are not sensitive to the continuum level of the planet spectrum, since we remove any broadband signal in our data analysis. Instead, we determine an unconvolved line contrast (the depth of the deepest lines with respect
to the continuum, divided by the stellar flux) of (4.5±0.9)×10−4
for the strongest CO lines. This line contrast indicates the difference between the thermal flux coming from the continuum level
at high pressure and the flux from the line cores, which probe
very low pressures (see Fig. 12). The line contrast thus depends
on the difference in temperatures at the pressures of the continuum and the line cores. Already it is clear that there is a large
degeneracy in the temperature structure of the atmosphere that
can reproduce a certain line contrast, since different sets of temperatures can have the same difference in flux. Furthermore, the
abundance of CO adds another ambiguity, since increasing the
CO abundance will decrease the pressure that is probed by the
line cores. It is therefore uncertain at what pressure the flux of
the line cores originates. This also means we cannot determine
CO abundances from line contrasts alone. Fig. 13 illustrates this
point. It shows the maximum line contrasts that were obtained
in our model grid (see Section 3). Note that in this grid we kept
temperatures at pressures above 0.1 bar fixed, meaning we basically fixed the continuum level, already reducing part of the
possible degeneracies. Furthermore, our grid only covered a selected portion of the parameter space. A lower limit on the line

In comparing our results with the claimed detection by

contrast comes from an isothermal atmosphere, which would not
show any lines (zero contrast). Fig. 13 shows that there is practically no dependence of the range of possible line contrasts on
the CO volume mixing ratio. Hence, more information is needed
before the CO abundance can be determined from these kinds
of high spectral resolution measurements, most notably the temperature profiles covering pressures from the continuum level
to the low pressures of the line cores. Constraints on the temperature profile can be obtained by measuring the thermal flux
(or secondary eclipse depths) at a range of wavelengths, probing a range of pressures due to differences in gas absorption
(e.g. Madhusudhan & Seager 2009; Line et al. 2012; Lee et al.
2012). However, lower resolution measurements do not probe
the low pressures of the line cores well. Also, there is still a
degeneracy with absolute gas abundances, since this determines
the pressure levels that are probed. Ideally, one would have a
single gas for which we know (or can estimate reliably) the absolute abundance, and which probes a wide range of pressures
from absorption lines or bands of different strengths. From measurements of this gas at different wavelengths the temperature
structure can then be determined, if the variation of the gas
abundance with pressure is known. CO2 plays this role in the
Venus atmosphere and CH4 in the atmospheres of Jupiter, Saturn
and Titan. Obtaining absolute gas abundances for giant exoplanet atmospheres is possible using transit (transmission) measurements if the H2 Rayleigh scattering slope is measured (e.g.
Benneke & Seager 2012), although this signature might be difficult to distinguish from that of small haze particles. In summary,
obtaining absolute gas abundances from line contrasts such as
the ones we present here is difficult, but the line contrasts can be
used as an additional constraint to reduce the uncertainty in retrievals. However, if multiple gases would be detected in a single
high resolution observation, this would make it possible to determine the relative abundances of these gases, since they would
both be reliant on the same temperature profile with the same
continuum level at the same time. There might still be some degeneracy caused by the line cores of the two gases probing two
different ranges of pressures, but these pressure ranges are likely
to overlap.

surements are consistent within their reported 1-σ error bars.
Rodler et al. (2013) find a CO line contrast of 1.8×10−4 at a spectral resolution of R=25,000 with NIRSPEC at Keck. Assuming
that the lines are unresolved, this translates to a line contrast of
∼7×10−4 at the CRIRES resolution, which is more than 50%
higher than what we find in our study. This may suggest that
the reliability of the Keck signal is somewhat overestimated.
However, the error bars on the line contrast of Rodler et al.
(2013) will probably be large, although these are not given in
their paper. Rodler et al. (2013) suggest a possible low CO abundance based on their analysis of the Keck data. Our line contrast is potentially even lower, but unfortunately we cannot yet
draw conclusions on the CO abundance based on the line contrast alone (see the discussion above). Taking their 3-σ detection
using 13 hours of NIRSPEC observations at face value, the 5σ detection presented here implies that CRIRES is a factor 7
more efficient. We attribute this to the high spectral resolution
and stability of CRIRES, and the well-performing adaptive optics system on the VLT.
Based on the available secondary eclipse data, retrieval
methods favour temperature profiles that decrease in temperature as pressure decreases, i.e. a temperature profile without an
inversion layer (Madhusudhan & Seager 2009; Line et al. 2012;
Lee et al. 2012). However, in recent work Pont et al. (2012) argue that, based on their transmission measurements and improved analysis of secondary eclipse data, HD 189733b could
also have temperatures that are increasing with decreasing pressure. This would then be the result of an optically thick haze
layer, for which they see the signature in the transit measurements. However, our detection of CO shows that the temperature profile is not inverted at the pressures probed by the CO
lines (10−5 -10−3 bar for a CO volume mixing ratio of 10−4 , as
seen in Fig. 12, and roughly an order of magnitude lower pressures for a CO volume mixing ratio of 10−3 ) and that the CO
lines are not obscured by an optically thick haze layer. In principle it is possible that we are only seeing the cores of the CO
lines sticking out above the haze in a higher part of the atmosphere where the temperatures decrease again with altitude, but
this would require large CO volume mixing ratios (> 10−4 ) if
the temperature profile of Pont et al. (2012), which shows an

de Kok et al.: CO in the atmosphere of HD 189733b

inversion down to at least 0.1 mbar, is correct. Such a high
CO abundance with absorption features above the haze layer
would then also be visible around 5 µm, where CO absorption is stronger than at 2.3 µm. Such a CO feature might indeed be visible in Spitzer data (Knutson et al. 2012). An optically thick haze layer would also require a cold atmospheric
layer above the haze layer, which is contrary to the conclusions
of Huitson et al. (2012). Hence, we conclude that the haze layer
seen by Pont et al. (2008); Sing et al. (2009); Pont et al. (2012)
is either optically thin when seen at normal incidence angles and
that consequently there is no temperature inversion in the middle atmosphere, or that the haze layer is optically thick, but low
enough for CO lines to be visible.
We could derive only upper limits for the line contrasts of
H2 O, CO2 and CH4 : 8.7×10−4 for H2 O and 1.8×10−3 for CO2
at 2.0 µm and 2.8×10−3 for H2 O and 8.3×10−4 for CH4 at 2.3
µm. Future observations, also at more optimal wavelengths, will
be needed to more effectively search for these gases and assess
their relative abundances. Less telluric absorption and a higher
planet-to-star contrast would be benificial in these observations.
However, it is not straightforward to identify an optimal wavelength for these observations. For instance, the planet-to-star
contrast is better at longer wavelengths, but there the sky background increases. Also, there is a trade-off between targeting
strong lines in the planet spectrum, while avoiding strong lines in
the telluric spectrum. A sensitivity study covering the CRIRES
wavelength range, using realistic instrument performance and
telluric absorption spectra, is needed to determine the optimal
wavelengths for detection of these gases using high resolution
spectroscopy. Note that the optimal observing wavelengths may
differ for different targets.

From the measured radial velocity of K p = 154+4

+0.068
we derive a stellar mass of M s = 0.846−0.049 M⊙ and a planet
mass of M p = 1.162+0.058
−0.039 MJup , independent of stellar spectral
modelling. These values are consistent with previously known
values and their errors are somewhat larger. However, combining these results with possible future observations at phases
larger than 0.5, as well as phases closer to 0.25 and 0.75, would
help significantly in reducing the error on K p , and hence in
the masses of the star and planet (e.g. Brogi et al. 2013). An
error in K p of 1 km s−1 would result in an error on the stellar mass of 0.017 M⊙ , which is more precise than the current value derived from spectral modelling. The ability to treat
transiting planet systems in the same manner as double-lined
eclipsing binaries (DLEBs) allows a model-independent measurement of the stellar and planet masses and radii, which is
particularly useful for planets with M-dwarf host stars. Precise
dynamical measurements of the masses and radii of low-mass
stars in DLEBs are not well-reproduced by stellar evolutions
models and have radii that are up to 15% larger than predicted
(L´opez-Morales & Ribas 2005; Ribas 2006). Strong magnetic
fields in the short-period low-mass DLEBs are thought to be responsible for the radius inflation (see e.g. Chabrier et al. 2007;
Morales et al. 2010). Even in higher mass G- and K-dwarfs,
strong magnetic activity in the stars results in disagreement with
stellar models (Morales et al. 2009). However, in wider separation M-dwarf DLEBs with magnetically inactive low-mass stars,
the radii are still inflated (Irwin et al. 2011; Doyle et al. 2011),
with no real convergence towards stellar models at longer periods (Birkby et al. 2012). Obtaining K p for planets transiting
M-dwarfs removes the uncertainty in stellar models and gives a
direct and accurate characterisation of the star-planet system.
