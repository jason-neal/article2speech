Context. After many attempts over more than a decade, high-resolution spectroscopy has recently delivered its first detections of molecular absorption in exoplanet atmospheres, both in transmission and thermal emission spectra. Targeting the combined signal from individual lines in molecular bands, these measurements use variations in the planet radial velocity to disentangle the planet signal from telluric and stellar contaminants.

Aims. In this paper we apply high resolution spectroscopy to probe molecular absorption in the day-side spectrum of the bright transiting hot Jupiter HD 189733b.

Methods. We observed HD 189733b with the CRIRES high-resolution near-infrared spectograph on the Very Large Telescope during three nights, targeting possible absorption from carbon monoxide, water vapour, methane and carbon dioxide, at 2.0 and 2.3 µm.

Results. We detect a 5-σ absorption signal from CO at a contrast level of ∼4.5×10−4 with respect to the stellar continuum, revealing the planet orbital radial velocity at 154+4 km s−1. This allows us to solve for the planet and stellar mass in a similar way as for stellar

Jup. No significant absorption is detected from H2O, CO2

or CH4 and we determined upper limits on their line contrasts here.

Conclusions. The detection of CO in the day-side spectrum of HD 189733b can be made consistent with the haze layer proposed to explain the optical to near-infrared transmission spectrum if the layer is optically thin at the normal incidence angles probed by our observations, or if the CO abundance is high enough for the CO absorption to originate from above the haze. Our non-detection of CO2 at 2.0 µm is not inconsistent with the deep CO2 absorption from low resolution NICMOS secondary eclipse data in the same wavelength range. If genuine, the absorption would be so strong that it blanks out any planet light completely in this wavelength range, leaving no high-resolution signal to be measured.

geometric airmass and subsequently with the residual signals

present in the strongest telluric lines, here we use singular value

decompositions (SVD, e.g. Kalman 1996). For this we used the algorithm available in IDL. The SVD decomposes a matrix A

into the following matrices:

A = UWVT ,

(1)

where U is the matrix of left singular vectors, W a (by def-

inition) diagonal matrix of singular values and V the matrix of

right singular vectors. In our case the matrix A represents the ar-

ray of spectra on a single detector, with the number of pixels and

number of spectra as dimensions. The right singular vectors are

the eigenvectors and the left singular vectors, scaled by the sin-

gular values, indicate how each of the eigenvectors are weighted

to form each observed spectrum. A convenient property of the

SVD is that matrix A can be approximated in an optimal way us-

ing only the largest few singular values, and setting the smaller

singular values to zero (e.g. Andrews & Patterson 1975). Here, we do the reverse and set the largest singular values to zero to

remove the signals that are static with time while affecting the

moving planet signal as little as possible. Fig. 1 shows an example of a matrix of spectra (detector 2 on the night of 13 July

2011) with progressive subtraction of the singular values for de-

tector 2 at 2.3 µm. Examples of the left and right singular vectors

are shown in Figs. 2 and 3.

The left singular vectors corresponding to the first two sin-

gular values of the 2.3 µm data show clear correlations with the

signal level in the continuum and the airmass for all four detec-

tors (see Figs. 2 and 4). Hence, the subtraction of the first two singular values is in effect very similar to the first steps used

by Snellen et al. (2010) and Brogi et al. (2012, 2013). Also the third left singular vector is very similar for all four detectors.

Its corresponding eigenvector (Fig. 3) indicates it is related to shifts and/or broadening of the lines in the spectrum and its behaviour with time is somewhat similar to parameters relevant to

the adaptive optics performance (see Fig. 4). The only parameter in the headers that was similar to the fourth left singular vector

is one of the temperature sensors in the instrument. The physical

correspondances of these third and fourth left singular vectors is

far from conclusive, with correlation coefficients of around 0.5

As a final step, we divide each column of the array of spectra

by the square of the standard deviation. This prevents the cross-
